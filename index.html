        <p>Ken Kaneki (金木 研, Kaneki Ken) is the main <br> protagonist of the Tokyo Ghoul series. He is currently <br> Touka Kirishima's husband, and the father of Ichika <br> Kaneki. Previously, he was a student who studied <br> Japanese literature at Kamii University, living a <br> relatively normal life. However, this quickly changed <br> after Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou was transplanted into <br> him and transformed him into a one-eyed ghoul. <br> Kaneki is the first known artificial one-eyed ghoul. His <br> unique half ghoul state is what later inspires the idea <br> of the Quinx. After joining Anteiku as a part-time <br> waiter, he learns how to live as a ghoul and eventually <br> becomes known as Eyepatch (眼帯, Gantai).</p>
